  <h2 id="video"> Video </h2>
  
  <p style = " text-align: justify; width:700px; ">Video is an electronic medium for the recording, copying , playback, broadcasting , and display of moving visual media .
    Video was first developed for mechanical television systems,
    which were quickly replaced by cathode ray tube (CRT) systems which were later replaced by flat panel displays of several types.
    Video systems vary in display resolution , aspect ratio , refresh rate , color capabilities and other qualities. 
    Analog and digital variants exist and can be carried on a variety of media, including radio broadcast , magnetic tape , optical discs , computer files ,

  <h2 id="game">Game </h2>

  <p style = " text-align: justify; width:700px; "> A game is a structured form of play, usually undertaken for entertainment or fun, 
    and sometimes used as an educational tool.[1] Games are distinct from work, which is usually carried out for remuneration, 
    and from art, which is more often an expression of aesthetic or ideological elements. 
    However, the distinction is not clear-cut, and many games are also considered to be work (such as professional players of spectator sports or games)
    or art (such as jigsaw puzzles or games involving an artistic layout such as Mahjong, solitaire, or some video games).
    Games are sometimes played purely for enjoyment, sometimes for achievement or reward as well. 
    They can be played alone, in teams, or online; by amateurs or by professionals.
    The players may have an audience of non-players, such as when people are entertained by watching a chess championship. 
    On the other hand, players in a game may constitute their own audience as they take their turn to play. 
    Often, part of the entertainment for children playing a game is deciding who is part of their audience and who is a player.</p>

  <h2 id="music"> Music </h2>

  <p style = " text-align: justify; width:700px; "> Music is an art form, and a cultural activity, whose medium is sound. 
    General definitions of music include common elements such as pitch (which governs melody and harmony), 
    rhythm (and its associated concepts tempo, meter, and articulation), dynamics (loudness and softness),
     and the sonic qualities of timbre and texture (which are sometimes termed the "color" of a musical sound).
      Different styles or types of music may emphasize, de-emphasize or omit some of these elements. 
      Music is performed with a vast range of instruments and vocal techniques ranging from singing to rapping; 
      there are solely instrumental pieces, solely vocal pieces (such as songs without instrumental accompaniment) and pieces that combine singing and instruments. 
      The word derives from Greek μουσική (mousike; "art of the Muses").</p>
